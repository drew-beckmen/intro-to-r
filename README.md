# Introduction to R

The files within this repository contain some **extremely basic** exploration of R's functions and capabilities
* `R1_tutorial.R` contains code from the live session
* `R1_hwexercises.R` contains my responses to the exercises distributed after the live session.

## Yale University: Center for Science and Social Science Information

The tutorials are led by a librarian at Yale University. I have been testing out R Studio Cloud and its Git integration as I progress through the training sessions.
